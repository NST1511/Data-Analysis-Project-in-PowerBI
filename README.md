# Data Analysis Project in Power BI

## Background

- This project analyzes the business and financial performance of a synthetic company that sells bicycles.
- The primary dataset is sales data, which has relationships with other data, including customer data (age and gender), product data, region, and calendar. Please see the schema below for details.

## Techniques Used

- Data was imported from different .csv files, transformed, and loaded into data tables, and then modeled as a data schema.
- DAX was used to create calculations and measurements to facilitate the analysis process.

## Report Structure

- **Page 1** contains high-level information and the latest month's financial metrics.
- **Page 2** includes a decomposition tree, which supports easy component analysis of revenue and profit.
- **Page 3** provides a deep analysis of financial metrics by product, a list of the most important products, and a scatter plot of products that could be used to identify the best products. In this case, the best products are those that have the highest revenue contribution as well as the highest profit margin.
- **Page 4** provides a deep analysis of financial metrics by customer in terms of region, age group, and gender.
